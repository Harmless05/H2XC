# About
This program was started over a year ago. The reason for it was I wanted something that would show the location of an IP address.

As I am just only one person the updates will be slow and small.

## Features
- IP to address (2nd image down below)
- Public and Local IP (shows your public and local IP)
- Changelog (self-explanatory)

## Download
Yes this program is free and you can download it here: [Download](https://github.com/Harmless05/H2XC/raw/main/H2XC.msi)

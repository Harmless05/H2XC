# About H2XC

Experience the power of H2XC, a free and open-source network utility tool designed to provide insights into the local network. This suite of tools offers a range of features to help you gain insight into your network with ease, including the ability to look up the location of any IP address and display your public and local IP addresses.

Although updates may be infrequent due to being developed by one person, H2XC remains a reliable and effective solution for network insight. Feel free to take a look and experience the benefits of this program for yourself.

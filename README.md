# About
This program allows you to lookup the location of an IP address. It also displays your public and local IP addresses. This project was started over a year ago, but has not been actively updated for some time. Despite this, it remains a useful tool for those looking to find the location of an IP address.

As I am just only one person the updates will be slow and small.

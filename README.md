# H2XC
This program was started over a year ago. The reason for it was I wanted something that would show the location of an IP address.

As I am just only one person the updates will be slow and small.

## Features
- IP to address (2nd image down below)
- Public and Local IP (shows your public and local IP)
- Changelog (self-explanatory)

## Download
Yes this program is free and you can download it here: [Download](https://github.com/Harmless05/H2XC/raw/main/H2XC.msi)

## Latest changes 2.0.0
 - Added a pop-up when opening the Public and Local IP submenu
 - Fixed fonts being weird when downloading the program (H2XC)
 - Fixed the changelog for the second time. Some text was out of bounds.
 - Fixed the desktop shortcut not having an icon
 - Fixed program files not going to a folder on the first setup
 - Moved "(MM.DD.YYYY)" and text "Changelog" from the changelog textbox to the first layer
 - Moved from version 1.0... to version 2.0

## Current bugs
- Changelogs scrollbar is a bit wonky
- Maximized window doesn't work as intended
- If you open the submenu 2 times or more it doesn't close the last one (Keeps using more and more memory)
- Some text are out of boundaries
- Not optimized that well

## Bigger things to be added soonᵀᴹ
- Overseer (IP/name type history for the IP you have looked up)
- Auto-updating
- Optimized better
